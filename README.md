# JavaScript Practice – Chapterwise Learning Journey

This repository contains my personal practice of JavaScript based on the book  
📘 "A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript"* by **Mark Myers**.

I’m completing one chapter at a time — practicing each topic with working examples,  
and uploading clean, professional `.html` files as I go.

## ✅ Chapters Completed So Far

### 📌 Chapter 01 – Alerts
- Practiced JavaScript `alert()` popups
- Used line breaks with `\n`

## 📅 What's Coming Next?
